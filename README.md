# Battleship

You should create a simple console application to allow a single human player to play a one-sided
game of battleships against the computer. The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place a
number of ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:
 1x Battleship (5 squares)
 2x Destroyers (4 squares)
The console application should accept input from the user in the format “A5” to signify a square to
target, and feedback to the user whether the shot was a success, and additionally report on the
sinking of any vessels
